# PURPOSE:
#     Compare multiple raw TAF result files and generate a unified comparison
#     report using the shared HTML renderer. This script loads Data::Dumper-
#     style raw arrays, tags each dataset deterministically, merges them into
#     a single combined structure, and delegates rendering to the TAF reporter
#     plugin chart_and_test_info_results_tables_html.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Acts as the generic multi-dataset comparison front-end for workloads
#       that already conform to the standard TAF raw results format.
#     - Normalizes dataset identity by assigning stable DatasetN tags.
#     - Ensures metadata structures exist for downstream rendering.
#     - Produces a contributor-proof combined array consumed by the reporter.
#     - Delegates all HTML generation to the shared reporter module to ensure
#       consistent formatting across TAF tools.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO:
#     - Does not compute averages, statistics, or per-query summaries.
#     - Does not validate workload semantics or enforce suite constraints.
#     - Does not modify raw input files or attempt to repair malformed data.
#     - Does not generate HTML directly; all rendering is delegated.
#     - Does not infer missing metadata fields.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Input files must contain valid Data::Dumper-style arrays.
#     - Each dataset must be taggable with a stable DatasetN identifier.
#     - Missing metadata hashes must be created but never guessed.
#     - At least two arguments plus an output directory must be provided.
#     - All failures must be explicit; unreadable or malformed inputs must
#       terminate execution.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - Dataset ordering is preserved and tags are deterministic.
#     - Combined results are contributor-proof and ready for the reporter.
#     - No silent fallbacks or partial merges occur.
#     - Output HTML is produced solely by the reporter module, ensuring
#       consistent structure across TAF comparison tools.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This script is intentionally minimal; its sole responsibility is to
#       load, tag, and combine datasets before handing them to the reporter.
#     - Any change to raw result structure or metadata expectations must be
#       reflected here and in the TAF documentation.
#     - The reporter module defines the authoritative HTML output format.

# TAF LOADER: load_raw_results()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE:
#   Load a raw TAF results file, extract the first valid Perl array literal,
#   remove Data::Dumper alias noise, and eval the cleaned structure into a
#   contributor-proof arrayref suitable for downstream processing.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#   - Acts as the canonical raw-results ingestion routine for comparison tools.
#   - Normalizes Data::Dumper output into a clean Perl data structure.
#   - Ensures all downstream logic receives a deterministic arrayref of
#     iteration hashes.
#
# WHAT THIS ROUTINE DOES NOT DO:
#   - Does not validate semantic correctness of the data.
#   - Does not repair malformed or truncated Dumper output.
#   - Does not attempt to interpret or coerce non-array structures.
#   - Does not silently skip errors; all failures are explicit.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   - Input file must exist, be readable, and contain a Dumper-style array.
#   - The first '[' character marks the start of the array literal.
#   - Dumper alias lines ($VAR1->...) must be stripped before eval.
#   - Eval must return an arrayref; otherwise execution terminates.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#   - No silent fallbacks or partial parsing.
#   - Only the first valid array literal is evaluated.
#   - Returned structure is deterministic and contributor-proof.
#   - All failures include actionable diagnostics.

# TAF NORMALIZER: tag and combine datasets
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE:
#   Load each raw results file, assign a deterministic DatasetN identifier,
#   ensure required metadata structures exist, and merge all iterations from
#   all datasets into a single combined array for downstream reporting.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#   - Acts as the dataset normalization and aggregation stage.
#   - Ensures every iteration record carries a stable user_id tag so the
#     reporter can group results by dataset.
#   - Guarantees that metadata exists for every record, even when missing
#     from the raw input.
#   - Produces a contributor-proof combined structure consumed by the
#     shared HTML reporter.
#
# WHAT THIS BLOCK DOES NOT DO:
#   - Does not modify or interpret metric values.
#   - Does not validate metadata correctness.
#   - Does not compute averages or summaries.
#   - Does not enforce cross-dataset compatibility rules.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   - Each input file must load successfully via load_raw_results().
#   - Each dataset receives a stable tag: Dataset1, Dataset2, ...
#   - Existing user_id/user_label fields are preserved unless missing.
#   - Metadata must exist for every record; empty hashes are created as needed.
#   - Combined output ordering must match input ordering.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#   - All datasets are merged deterministically and without mutation of
#     original semantics.
#   - No silent fallbacks; missing or malformed data triggers explicit failure.
#   - Combined array is ready for GenerateResults() with no additional
#     transformation required.
#   - Contributor-proof behavior: identical inputs always produce identical
#     combined structures.
