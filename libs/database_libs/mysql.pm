#
# PURPOSE:
#     Provide a deterministic, contributor-proof implementation of the
#     MySQL backend lifecycle for the Test Automation Framework (TAF).
#     This plugin encapsulates all logic required to initialize, configure,
#     start, stop, restart, and validate a MySQL server instance under
#     TAF control. It receives all configuration at construction time and
#     performs all engine-specific behavior behind a stable, version-aware
#     plugin API. The plugin is responsible for bootstrap SQL, user and
#     permission setup, runtime startup, shutdown, authentication plugin
#     validation, SSL/TLS flag construction, and liveness checks, ensuring
#     that every MySQL instance behaves predictably across all supported
#     versions, packaging formats, and installation layouts.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Implements the complete MySQL lifecycle:
#           init -> bootstrap -> users -> permissions -> start -> stop
#     - Implements the MySQL-specific backend lifecycle for TAF.
#     - Encapsulates all engine-specific behavior behind a stable plugin API.
#     - Receives all configuration at construction time; does not depend on
#       global framework state or the $ctx structure.
#     - Normalizes installation layout, runtime paths, and configuration.
#     - Enforces explicit contracts for SSL/TLS, authentication plugins,
#       readiness checks, and shutdown semantics.
#     - Ensures deterministic fork/exec behavior with no shell involvement.
#     - Provides contributor-proof behavior for:
#           * db_init()
#           * db_start()
#           * db_stop()
#           * db_restart()
#           * db_ping()
#     - Handles all MySQL version-aware behavior, including:
#           * 5.x through 8.0.x secure/insecure initialization
#           * 8.4.x authentication plugin enablement
#           * 9.x removal of mysql_native_password
#           * SSL/TLS capability mapping across versions
#
# NOTE:
#     This plugin is fully self-contained. All SQL required for bootstrap,
#     user creation, grants, and lifecycle validation is executed through the
#     mysql and mysqladmin client binaries. No external SQL libraries are used.
#     This module does not provide a general-purpose SQL execution API for
#     test suites; it performs only the SQL needed for the MySQL lifecycle.
#
# WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO:
#     - Does not parse framework properties.
#     - Does not resolve active installs.
#     - Does not load itself (handled by TAF::Database::ValidateInstallLoadDbPlugin()).
#     - Does not manage test suite state or framework lifecycle.
#     - Does not perform general SQL execution for test suites.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Must be instantiated via -> new(%args) with all required DB configuration.
#     - Must implement db_ping(), db_start(), db_stop(), and db_init()
#       without requiring the framework context.
#     - Must not modify global TAF state.
#     - Must return OK/ERROR codes consistently.
#     - Authentication plugin state must be resolved only by
#       _db_auth_plugin_guard().
#     - Bootstrap and runtime servers must remain strictly separated.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - Engine-specific lifecycle behavior is isolated from the driver.
#     - All filesystem paths, binaries, and runtime directories are validated.
#     - Initialization mode (secure, insecure, legacy) is selected
#       deterministically based on version capabilities.
#     - SSL/TLS flags are computed using a unified TAF contract.
#     - Startup and shutdown behavior is deterministic and contributor-proof.
#     - No shell is invoked for backgrounding or quoting; all exec() calls use
#       argv lists for safety and determinism.

# db_init
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Execute the full MySQL initialization lifecycle. This routine brings a
#     fresh MySQL instance from an empty datadir to a fully initialized state,
#     applies users and permissions, and prepares the installation for normal
#     runtime startup.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Implements the initialization phase of the MySQL plugin lifecycle.
#     - Validates binaries, configuration, and all required runtime paths.
#     - Normalizes installation layout and resolves version-aware capabilities.
#     - Performs secure, insecure, or legacy initialization depending on server
#       support.
#     - Starts a temporary bootstrap mysqld instance for user provisioning.
#     - Applies root credentials, tester user creation, and permissions.
#     - Shuts down the bootstrap server cleanly before returning control.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Validates required binaries and configuration files.
#     - Loads config-derived paths and normalizes runtime directories.
#     - Detects initialization capabilities (secure, insecure, legacy).
#     - Prepares the datadir and normalizes installation layout.
#     - Validates authentication plugin compatibility for the target version.
#     - Runs the appropriate initialization mode.
#     - Launches a temporary bootstrap mysqld instance.
#     - Applies root password, test users, and permissions.
#     - Stops the bootstrap server and verifies clean shutdown.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - $self->{mysqld_bin} must be executable.
#     - install_root, datadir, and runtime paths must be valid and writable.
#     - Authentication plugin selection must be compatible with the server
#       version.
#     - Returns OK only when initialization and user provisioning succeed.
#     - On failure, logs are written to initialization and bootstrap logs.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - Initialization mode selection is deterministic and version-aware.
#     - Bootstrap mysqld inherits all required flags, including SSL and
#       authentication plugin directives.
#     - No shell is invoked during bootstrap startup or shutdown.
#     - All lifecycle steps are logged with contributor-proof clarity.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine performs initialization only. Normal runtime startup is
#       handled by db_start().
#     - User provisioning occurs exclusively through the bootstrap server to
#       avoid side effects on the final runtime instance.

# db_start
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Start the full MySQL runtime server in a deterministic, contributor-safe
#     manner. This routine launches the normal mysqld instance (not bootstrap),
#     applies all configured runtime flags, and waits for the server to become
#     responsive before returning control.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Implements the runtime startup phase of the MySQL plugin lifecycle.
#     - Uses fork/exec via _spawn_background() to guarantee correct PID
#       tracking and eliminate shell-dependent behavior.
#     - Builds a clean argv list for exec(), avoiding quoting hazards and
#       ensuring reproducible behavior across environments.
#     - Normalizes all runtime paths (socket, tmpdir, error log, pidfile)
#       before startup.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Constructs the full mysqld command line as an argv list.
#     - Applies connectivity, SSL/TLS, authentication plugin flags, tmpdir,
#       plugin-dir, redo/undo log directories, and any extra arguments.
#     - Wraps the command in taskset when CPU affinity is configured.
#     - Redirects stdout/stderr to mysqld_start.log via _spawn_background().
#     - Writes the runtime pidfile and waits for readiness using
#       mysqladmin ping through _wait_for_start().
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - $self->{mysqld_bin} must be executable.
#     - ensure_runtime_paths() must be called before startup.
#     - All required paths (config, datadir, tmpdir, error log) must exist.
#     - Returns OK only when mysqld is confirmed ready.
#     - On success, the runtime PID is read from the pidfile and stored in
#       $self->{db_pid} for downstream consumers (e.g., rest-watch logic).
#     - On failure, logs are written to mysqld_start.log and error_log.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - No shell is invoked; no "&" backgrounding or quoting hazards.
#     - PID tracking is deterministic and stored in runtime_pidfile.
#     - $self->{db_pid} is populated with a validated PID on success.
#     - Startup behavior is identical across environments and shells.
#     - All flags are passed exactly as intended via exec() argv.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine starts the normal runtime server, not the bootstrap
#       server used during initialization.
#     - Shutdown is handled by db_stop(), which uses mysqladmin shutdown.

# db_stop
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Stop the running MySQL runtime server cleanly using mysqladmin. This
#     routine performs only the shutdown sequence; it does not modify users,
#     permissions, configuration, or any other database state. It is the
#     authoritative runtime shutdown stage for the MySQL plugin.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Resolves and validates the mysqladmin binary.
#     - Builds a deterministic shutdown command using:
#           * socket (preferred) or host/port
#           * root credentials
#     - Redirects all stdout/stderr to mysqld_stop.log in tmpdir (or datadir
#       as a fallback when tmpdir is not defined).
#     - Executes the shutdown command and evaluates only the exit code.
#     - Calls _wait_for_stop() to verify that mysqld has fully terminated
#       (process, socket, and pidfile gone).
#     - Marks the instance as no longer started.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - This routine stops the runtime server only; it does not interact with
#       bootstrap instances or initialization paths.
#     - mysqladmin must be executable; failure to resolve it is a hard ERROR.
#     - A return value of OK guarantees that mysqld has fully stopped.
#     - On failure, the stop log is preserved for postmortem debugging and
#       StageEnd() is omitted to maintain lifecycle invariants.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - No shell backgrounding ("&") or unsafe quoting is used.
#     - Shutdown behavior is deterministic across environments.
#     - All errors are explicit; no silent failures or partial shutdown states.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine does not remove the pidfile; _wait_for_stop() ensures the
#       server has already removed it or that the process is gone.
#     - This is the MySQL counterpart to the MariaDB plugin's db_stop(), and
#       both share the same lifecycle semantics.

# db_restart
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Perform a controlled runtime restart of the MySQL server. This routine
#     stops the currently running mysqld instance and then starts a fresh one
#     using the same configuration, datadir, socket, and runtime paths. It
#     performs no user, permission, or configuration changes; it is strictly
#     a process-level restart operation.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Invokes db_stop() to shut down mysqld cleanly.
#     - Logs and returns ERROR immediately if shutdown fails.
#     - Waits briefly to avoid race conditions with lingering PID files,
#       file locks, or socket cleanup.
#     - Invokes db_start() to launch a new mysqld instance.
#     - Logs and returns ERROR if startup fails.
#     - Updates the internal started flag only on successful restart.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Restart is not transactional. If db_stop() succeeds but db_start()
#       fails, the server remains down and no rollback is attempted.
#     - Caller is responsible for handling restart failures.
#     - StageStart/StageEnd are used for deterministic lifecycle logging;
#       StageEnd is omitted on failure to preserve lifecycle invariants.
#     - This routine restarts the normal runtime server, not any bootstrap
#       or initialization server.

# db_ping
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Determine whether the MySQL runtime server is responsive by invoking
#     mysqladmin ping. This is a lightweight liveness check used by the
#     runtime lifecycle; it does not perform SQL execution or validate
#     authentication beyond what mysqladmin requires.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Validates that the mysqladmin binary is resolved and executable.
#     - Builds a deterministic ping command using:
#           * socket (preferred) or host/port fallback
#           * root credentials when provided
#     - Redirects all output to /dev/null to avoid noise in logs.
#     - Executes the command and evaluates only the exit code.
#     - Returns OK when mysqladmin reports the server is alive; otherwise ERROR.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - This routine checks liveness only; it does not verify SQL-layer
#       readiness or server health.
#     - No StageStart/StageEnd semantics are used; db_ping is intentionally
#       lightweight and side-effect-free.
#     - Caller is responsible for ensuring that runtime paths (socket, port,
#       credentials) are valid.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This is the MySQL counterpart to the MariaDB plugin's db_ping(), but
#       uses mysqladmin instead of a SQL executor for parity with MySQL's
#       native tooling.
#     - A non-zero exit code is treated as a definitive liveness failure.

# db_pid
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Return the runtime PID of the database server as captured during
#     db_start(). This provides a deterministic, plugin-owned mechanism for
#     exposing the server's process ID to upstream consumers (e.g., rest-watch
#     logic, monitoring, or lifecycle coordination).
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Part of the database plugin's public interface.
#     - Provides a stable, shell-free, contributor-safe way for TAF and
#       testtoolsLib to obtain the server PID.
#     - Ensures that PID ownership remains inside the plugin that launched
#       the server, avoiding guessing, scanning, or external process discovery.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Returns the integer PID if it has been populated and validated.
#     - Returns undef if the PID is missing, undefined, or not a valid integer.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - $self->{db_pid} must be populated by db_start() after successful
#       startup. db_start() is responsible for reading the pidfile and storing
#       the validated PID.
#     - Callers must treat undef as a failure to retrieve a valid PID.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - No process scanning, no shelling out, no heuristics.
#     - Returns only the PID that the plugin itself launched and validated.
#     - Behavior is deterministic and identical across environments.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine does not attempt to read the pidfile. That responsibility
#       belongs exclusively to db_start().
#     - A valid PID is required for rest-watch and other process-level
#       monitoring features.

# _db_start_bootstrap
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Launch a minimal, isolated bootstrap mysqld instance used only during
#     initialization. This server runs with no defaults, no networking, no
#     plugins, and no user configuration. It exists solely to allow creation
#     of system tables, root credentials, and initial grants.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Provides a deterministic, contributor-proof bootstrap environment.
#     - Starts mysqld with a dedicated socket, pidfile, and error log under
#       the TAF tmpdir to avoid permission issues and external interference.
#     - Uses fork/exec via _spawn_background() to eliminate shell-dependent
#       behavior and ensure correct PID tracking.
#     - Ensures bootstrap mysqld is ready before returning control.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Builds a minimal argv list for exec() with no shell quoting.
#     - Forces --no-defaults and --skip-networking for deterministic startup.
#     - Overrides secure-file-priv to avoid platform-specific failures.
#     - Applies auth plugin flags when required.
#     - Waits for the bootstrap socket to appear, then verifies readiness
#       using mysqladmin ping via _db_ping_socket().
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - $self->{mysqld_bin} must be executable.
#     - $self->{tmpdir} or $self->{data_dir} must exist and be writable.
#     - Caller must have prepared the data directory and runtime paths.
#     - Returns OK only when bootstrap mysqld is confirmed ready.
#     - On failure, logs are written to bootstrap_error.log.
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - No user configuration or my.cnf files are loaded.
#     - No TCP networking is enabled; socket-only execution is enforced.
#     - PID and log files are always placed under tmpdir for safety.
#     - Behavior is identical across shells and platforms due to fork/exec.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This server is temporary and must be stopped by _db_stop_bootstrap().
#     - This routine does not apply grants or create users; it only starts
#       the bootstrap instance. Higher-level routines perform SQL setup.

#     Create and configure all required database users after the server has
#     been initialized and the bootstrap mysqld instance is running. This
#     routine applies the final root password, provisions the tester user,
#     assigns permissions, and enforces SSL requirements when configured.
#
# ARCHITECTURAL ROLE:
#     - Implements the user provisioning phase of the initialization lifecycle.
#     - Uses the bootstrap server exclusively to avoid side effects on the
#       final runtime instance.
#     - Emits version-aware CREATE USER and ALTER USER SQL based on the
#       mysql_native_password flag and earlier authentication validation.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Updates the root@localhost password when configured.
#     - Drops any existing tester user ('user'@'%').
#     - Creates the tester user with the configured authentication method.
#     - Applies mysql_native_password when enabled and supported by the server.
#     - Grants configured permissions on *.* to the tester user.
#     - Applies REQUIRE SSL when ssl_mode is not "off" or "prefer".
#     - Marks users_created = TRUE on success.
#     - Returns ERROR immediately on any SQL failure.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Bootstrap mysqld must be running and reachable via socket or port.
#     - Authentication plugin compatibility must have been validated earlier
#       during db_init() and db_start().
#     - mysql_native_password usage must reflect server version capabilities.
#     - Permissions beyond the tester user are delegated to db_set_permissions().
#
# GUARANTEES:
#     - All SQL is executed deterministically through internal query helpers.
#     - No shell is invoked; all operations use direct SQL execution.
#     - User provisioning is isolated to the bootstrap server only.
#     - Logs clearly record each step and any failure point.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine does not modify configuration files or runtime settings.
#     - MySQL 8+/9.x may require db_set_permissions() to be a no-op depending
#       on privilege model changes.

# _db_execute_no_return_query
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Execute a SQL statement that does not return result rows (e.g., ALTER,
#     CREATE, DROP, GRANT). This routine is used for administrative and
#     lifecycle SQL where only success/failure matters. It provides a
#     deterministic, socket-only execution path for both bootstrap and
#     runtime phases.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Validates that the mysql client binary is resolved and executable.
#     - Selects the connection socket in priority order:
#           1) bootstrap_socket (when running under bootstrap mysqld)
#           2) runtime socket
#     - Selects authentication mode:
#           * Bootstrap mode (secure or insecure) when use_bootstrap_root => TRUE.
#           * Normal root credentials otherwise.
#     - Escapes the SQL string for safe inclusion inside a double-quoted
#       shell command (backslashes, double quotes, and $).
#     - Constructs a deterministic mysql command line and executes it via system().
#     - Logs the SQL and the constructed command for contributor-proof diagnostics.
#     - On failure, logs an error, records last_error, and returns ERROR.
#     - On success, returns OK.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - This routine requires a local UNIX socket; TCP connectivity is never used.
#     - This routine performs no result parsing and no SQL interpretation.
#     - Caller is responsible for selecting bootstrap vs normal authentication.
#     - StageStart/StageEnd are used for lifecycle logging; StageEnd is omitted
#       on failure to preserve lifecycle invariants.
#     - last_error is updated only on failure.
#
# NOTES:
#     - Used heavily during initialization, bootstrap user creation, and
#       administrative operations where only the exit code matters.
#     - For queries that return rows, use db_execute_query() instead.
#     - Bootstrap mode supports both secure (temporary password) and insecure
#       (empty password) flows depending on root_bootstrap_mode.

# _db_detect_capabilities
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Detect whether the mysqld binary supports the initialization flags
#     --initialize and/or --initialize-insecure. Capability detection is based
#     on parsing the output of `mysqld --help --verbose` (two variants for
#     compatibility). Returns a pair of booleans indicating support.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Requires $self->{mysqld_bin} to be set and executable.
#     - Executes mysqld with --help --verbose in two argument orders.
#     - Searches for explicit flag tokens only (never generic substrings).
#     - Returns a two-element list:
#           ($supports_insecure, $supports_secure)
#       where each element is TRUE or FALSE.
#
# WHEN CALLED:
#     - Plugin internal use only.
#     - Called during plugin initialization to determine which initialization
#       mode (secure or insecure) is available for db_initialize().
#
# INPUT:
#     $self   Plugin object reference.
#
# OUTPUT:

#
# SIDE EFFECTS:
#     - Executes mysqld via backticks.
#     - Does not emit errors; silent capability detection.
#
# FAILURE MODES:
#     - If mysqld output cannot be parsed, both capabilities may return FALSE.
#     - Caller must treat FALSE/FALSE as "no initialization flags available".
#
# NOTES:
#     - Detection is intentionally strict: only explicit flag patterns match.

#
# PURPOSE:
#     Ensure the MySQL data directory is in a clean, empty state prior to

# _db_normalize_layout
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Normalize the MySQL installation layout when the distribution uses an
#     RPM-style directory structure. Some RPM-based installs place errmsg.sys
#     under:
#
#         $base/usr/share/mysql-<ver>/english/
#
#     whereas tarball-style installs expect it under:
#
#         $base/share/mysql-<ver>/english/
#
#     This routine detects the RPM-style location and moves errmsg.sys into the
#     tarball-style location so that mysqld can locate its error message file
#     consistently. If the tarball-style file already exists, no action is taken.
#
# WHY THIS NORMALIZATION EXISTS:
#     Although TAF normalizes all database software installs that it manages,
#     the plugin cannot assume that the active install was created by TAF.
#     Users may point TAF at:
#         - system-installed packages (RPM, DEB)
#         - vendor-provided builds
#         - custom or legacy installs
#         - manually copied directories
#         - pre-existing installs outside the TAF installs root
#
#     Because these installs may not follow the expected tarball-style layout,
#     the plugin performs a small, targeted normalization step to ensure that
#     mysqld/mariadbd can locate required files (such as errmsg.sys) before
#     initialization or startup. This normalization is:
#         - idempotent
#         - safe
#         - silent
#         - limited in scope
#
#     The plugin must remain self-sufficient and able to run the database
#     deterministically even when the install library was bypassed or when
#     the install originates outside of TAF control.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - $self->{install_root} must be set to the root of the MySQL installation.
#     - If no RPM-style layout is detected, the routine returns silently.
#     - If errmsg.sys already exists in the tarball-style location, no action.
#     - If errmsg.sys exists only in the RPM-style location, it is moved.
#     - Returns nothing; silent normalization.
#     - Dies only if the final rename() operation fails.
#
# WHEN CALLED:
#     - Plugin-internal use only.
#     - Called during plugin initialization before any mysqld startup.
#     - Ensures a deterministic, unified layout regardless of packaging format.
#
# INPUT:
#     $self   Plugin object reference.
#
# OUTPUT:
#     None (implicit return).
#
# SIDE EFFECTS:
#     - Creates the tarball-style directory path if missing.
#     - Moves errmsg.sys from RPM-style to tarball-style location.
#
# FAILURE MODES:
#     - rename() failure triggers a fatal die().
#     - Directory scanning or mkpath failures cause silent return (no change).
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine does not attempt to normalize any other files or directories.

#     by forcing secure-file-priv to tmpdir and appending it to the config.
#
# CONTRACT:

################################################################################ ensure_runtime_paths
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Normalize and finalize all runtime paths (socket, tmpdir, error log,
#     pidfile locations, start/stop logs, etc.) exactly once per plugin
#     lifecycle. This wrapper provides an idempotent guard around
#     _db_normalize_runtime_paths() so callers may invoke it freely without
#     repeating work or re-normalizing paths.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Returns immediately if runtime paths have already been normalized.
#     - Otherwise calls _db_normalize_runtime_paths() to populate all derived
#       runtime paths based on configuration, installation layout, and engine
#       conventions.
#     - Marks normalization as complete so subsequent calls are cheap and
#       side-effect-free.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - Must be called before db_start(), db_stop(), bootstrap routines, and
#       any operation that relies on resolved runtime paths.
#     - The underlying normalizer must itself be idempotent; this wrapper
#       side-effect-free.
#     - This routine performs no filesystem creation or permission checks;
#       those responsibilities belong to earlier lifecycle stages.
#
# NOTES:
#     - Updates $self in place and returns nothing.

# _detect_mysql_version
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Detect the MySQL server version by invoking "mysqld --version" and
#     extracting the major, minor, and incremental components. This routine
#     provides a lightweight, dependency-free mechanism for version detection
#     and is used to support version-aware configuration decisions.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Executes the mysqld binary with the --version flag.
#     - Parses the first occurrence of N.N.N from the output.
#     - Returns a hashref containing:
#           major => integer
#           minor => integer
#           incr  => integer
#     - Falls back to zeroes when parsing fails, ensuring callers always
#       receive a defined structure.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - This routine performs no capability detection and no validation of
#       server features; it extracts version numbers only.
#     - Callers must treat a 0.0.0 result as "unknown version" and handle it
#       explicitly.
#     - Output format of `mysqld --version` is stable across MySQL 5.x-9.x,
#       but callers must not assume additional tokens or metadata.
#     - This routine does not modify object state; it is a pure helper.
#
# NOTES:
#     - Intended for use during plugin initialization and binary validation.
#     - The caller is responsible for ensuring that $mysqld is executable.

#     This routine ensures version-safe, contributor-proof behavior across
#     MySQL 5.x-9.x without emitting deprecated or removed flags.
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - ssl_mode = "off":
#           * MySQL < 8.0.33:
#                 returns "--ssl=0"
#           * MySQL >= 8.0.33:
#                 returns "" (no TLS flags; SSL disabled implicitly)
#
#     - ssl_mode = "prefer":
#           * Returns only CA/cert/key/CRL/cipher flags that are defined.
#           * Server allows SSL; clients may choose whether to use it.
#
#     - ssl_mode = "require", "verify_ca", "verify_identity":
#           * Returns CA/cert/key/CRL/cipher flags that are defined.
#           * Server is placed in "SSL enabled" mode; strictness is enforced
#             entirely on the client side.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - This routine never disables SSL when ssl_mode != "off".
#     - No MySQL-specific client-side ssl_mode behavior is implemented here;
#       client enforcement is handled separately.
#     - File existence is not validated; callers must perform validation
#       earlier in the lifecycle if required.
#     - Returned flags are safe for direct inclusion in exec() argv lists.
#
# NOTES:
#     - MySQL 8.0.33 removed --ssl=0 and deprecated TLS-version disabling

#     - MySQL 8.4.x:
#           * Plugin exists but is disabled by default.

#           * The server version supports mysql_native_password, and
#           * The plugin state has been fully resolved for the lifecycle.
#
#     - A return value of ERROR indicates that native-password mode cannot
#       be honored and initialization/startup must not continue.
#
# NOTES:
#     - MySQL 9.x still ships a client-side mysql_native_password.so for
#       backward compatibility, but mysqld cannot load it.
#     - This guard does not inspect plugin_dir or filesystem layout; version
#       semantics alone determine support.
#     - Downstream routines (bootstrap, user creation, startup) must treat
#       this routine as the sole authority for plugin behavior.
#
# RETURNS:
#     OK    - native-password usage is allowed and state is set.
#     ERROR - server version cannot support mysql_native_password.

# _spawn_background
#
# PURPOSE:
#     Launch a long-running daemon (mysqld or mariadbd) without invoking a
#     shell. This routine replaces all uses of system("cmd &") and provides:
#         - deterministic fork/exec behavior
#         - correct PID tracking
#         - no shell quoting or splitting issues
#         - no dependency on /bin/sh
#         - identical behavior across MySQL and MariaDB plugins
#
# BEHAVIOR:
#     - Forks the current process.
#     - Child:
#         * Redirects stdout/stderr to the specified logfile.
#         * Detaches from the parent session (setsid()).
#         * Executes the daemon via exec(@cmd_ref).
#         * On exec() failure, prints an error and exits non-zero.
#     - Parent:
#         * Performs a brief liveness check to detect immediate exec failure.
#         * Reaps the child if it died before exec() (avoids zombies).
#         * Writes the child's PID to the provided pidfile.
#         * Returns OK on success or ERROR on failure.
#
# CONTRACT:
#     - @cmd_ref must be an argv list, not a shell string. No quoting,
#       redirection, or backgrounding may be included.
#     - $pidfile is created and written by the parent after fork() and after
#       confirming the child is alive.
#     - $logfile receives all stdout/stderr from the daemon.
#     - Caller is responsible for readiness checks (socket + ping).
#     - Returns OK or ERROR only; no partial-success semantics.
#
# NOTES:
#     - This routine performs no lifecycle logging (no StageStart/StageEnd);
#       it is a low-level primitive used by db_start() and bootstrap routines.
#     - All backgrounding and output routing are handled internally; callers
#       must not append "&" or redirections.
#     - The liveness check is essential: fork() success does not guarantee
#       exec() success. Without this check, stale PID files and false-positive
#       "start succeeded" states can occur.
